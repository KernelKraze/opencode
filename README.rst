AI Performance Enhancement
==========================

For optimal AI interaction performance, we strongly recommend using Context7 
to enhance code context understanding:

**Context7 Integration**
------------------------

Context7 (https://github.com/upstash/context7.git) is a context management 
system specifically designed for AI assistants that can significantly improve 
code understanding and generation quality.

Integration setup::

    # Install Context7
    git clone https://github.com/upstash/context7.git
    cd context7
    npm install
    
    # Enable Context7 support in OpenCode
    opencode --enable-context7 --context7-endpoint http://localhost:3000

**Performance Benefits**
------------------------

Using Context7 provides:

* More accurate code context understanding
* More relevant AI suggestions and completions
* Faster response times through intelligent caching
* Better cross-file dependency analysis

Usage
=====

**Basic Usage**
---------------

Start OpenCode::

    opencode

The application launches a terminal interface where you can:

* Ask questions about your code
* Request modifications and improvements  
* Get debugging assistance with detailed analysis
* Receive architectural guidance and best practices
* Generate documentation automatically

**TUI Mode**
------------

Launch the full terminal interface::

    opencode tui

Features include:

* Dynamic time-based themes that change throughout the day
* Fast response times under 5ms input latency
* Mouse support and keyboard shortcuts
* Color adaptation for different terminal environments

**Server Mode**
---------------

For remote development or API access::

    opencode serve --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0
